# simple-bank-OOP
Hello, this is a simple bank project with C++ using OOP.
every class is separated into its header file, you will find them all in the header files folder.
also, you will find some headers like (string, date, and input validate) I used these files to make it easier 
first of all you have to log in to the system (you can use username: admin / and password: admin) to login at the first time and you will have full access
you will the main screen and you have 9 options: 
                                                   [1] Show Client List.
                                                   [2] Add New Client.
                                                   [3] Delete Client.
                                                   [4] Update Client Info.
                                                   [5] Find Client.
                                                   [6] Transactions.
                                                   [7] Manage Users.
                                                   [8] Log In Registers List.
                                                   [9] Logout.
the first 5 operations will be saved to the (Clients.txt) file, note: the first time you log in you will have no clients so you have to add them first

if you choose transactions you will find this menu:
                                                  [1] Deposit.
                                                  [2] Withdraw.
                                                  [3] Total Balances.
                                                  [4] Transfers.
                                                  [5] Transfers Log.
                                                  [6] Main Menu.
also, you have to add clients first so you can deposit, withdraw, show total balances, or transfer money (all transactions will be saved to Clients.txt)
note: all transfers will be saved to the transfer log menu and transfers_log.txt

if you choose to manage users you will find this menu:                                        
                                                  [1] List Users.
                                                  [2] Add New User.
                                                  [3] Delete User.
                                                  [4] Update User.
                                                  [5] Find User.
                                                  [6] Main Menu.
you will have only one user with full permissions and you can add users as you want 
you will have to give every user his own permissions if you give full permissions it will assign -1, or give the permissions to access specific screens from the main screen 
note all users data will be saved to (users.txt) and passwords will be encrypted

finally  every login to (LogIn_Register.txt)
